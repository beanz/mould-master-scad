Mould Master library for Openscad
=================================

Feedback very welcome
---------------------

My youngest son (not the one responsible for inspiring me to create
https://github.com/beanz/celtic-knot-scad) wanted to eat his own head
made from chocolate. So I created a simple openscad library to help
make food-safe silicone moulds.

My initial moulds looked like:

![face mould](https://github.com/beanz/mould-master-scad/raw/master/examples/jpgs/face-master-and-mould.jpg "Face Master and Mould")

The chocolates looked like:

![face chocolate](https://github.com/beanz/mould-master-scad/raw/master/examples/jpgs/face-choc.jpg "Face Chocolate")

They were tasty and I knew I was going to want to make more chocolates
so this library attempts to make the process easier. It attempts to be
efficient by reducing the amount of silicone required to fill the
mould master to a minimum.  For exmaple, the
[So Make It](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/) logo master requires just
enough silicone to keep its shape.

Similarly, the [Sad Face](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1350837) master looks like:

![sad face master](https://github.com/beanz/mould-master-scad/raw/master/examples/jpgs/sad-face-chocs.jpg "Sad Face Master")


Thanks

I'd attempted to make chocolates using food safe silicone for some
time but it was thanks to Richard Horne (RichRap) for his
[fabulous Trio project](http://richrap.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/using-3d-printing-for-taste-of.html)
write up that I was able to find the perfect silicone that is soft
enough to get the chocolates out in one piece.
